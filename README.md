# Deskmini-110-hackintosh

Deskmini110/COM hackintosh profile.

Both opencore and clover are supported, the latest system tested is Catalina 10.15.2.

### Warning: I have tested them on my build without problem. However, specific hardware differs, use it at your own risk.

### Usage

Please follow [ this guide ](https://hackintosh.gitbook.io/-r-hackintosh-vanilla-desktop-guide/) to start a clean catalina install and replace EFI folder with opencore or clover EFI in this repository.

I have not tested them under Mojave so please do not use them for Mojave to avoid any boot failure problem.

### Others
The EFI here **doesn't contain** any kext for Wi-Fi and bluetooth cards and SMBIOS information. Please find suitable kexts for Wi-Fi cards and generate your own SMBIOS to be able to use iMessage.
