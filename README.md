Deskmini110/COM hackintosh profile.

Both opencore and clover is supported, the latest system supported is Catalina 10.15.2.

### Warning: I have tested them on my build without problem. However, specific hardware differs, use it at your own risk.

### Usage

Please follow [ this guide ](https://hackintosh.gitbook.io/-r-hackintosh-vanilla-desktop-guide/) to start a clean catalina install and replace EFI folder with opencore or clover EFI in this repository.

The EFI here **doesn't contain** any kext support of Wi-Fi and bluetooth cards. Besides, remember to generate your own SMBIOS to be able to use iMessage.
